This is the user guide for Northrend Data Resources

as you can see, there are 2 groups EPNews and EPUser

we use sqlite as our target database

EPNews and EPUser have similar function, so take EPUserDataManager and EPUserManagedObject as Example.

EPUserManagedObject is our object in database. For better understanding, treat one instance of EPUserManagedObject as one record in the database

an user have 3 properties by the time this guide is writing. they are username, password and email,and they are all NSString.
    so send a message of property name for the object to get the content of the data.
for example: we have a instance tmpUser
[tmpUser username]; - this will get you a username with type NSString*
